## The beginning of my journey 

I embarked on my IT journey in July 2023, transitioning from a non-programming background. 

In this time I have learned Microsoft SQL Server during my job. Since I was looking for a Sysadmin Job I also finished a course on Linux Administration and another one for Python Development 🐍

Currently, I'm exploring diverse projects, including GameDev, hosting a personal Linux Media Server, and taking on various Python endeavors. Driven by a love for learning and a spirit of experimentation.

## Envisioning the future

My journey has just begun and I am eagerly doing my best to gain knowledge and practice. The goal I am aiming for is a job in IT as a Linux Sysadmin. 

Of course I am not ignoring state of the art technologies. I am a little bit late to the party but once I am more familar with my field I want to widen my skillset there too!

## Projects

### Disclaimer 

Since I am still new in programming I don't have lots of projects. Maintaining a fulltime job while learning is a task that should rather not be underestimated. 

However I think it's still best practice to tackle some problems that might happen in projects that are close to reality. 

### 1. Discord Bot
- Started as a 'dive into it' project, evolved into two bots.
- One is a beginner-friendly meme provider.
- The other is a sophisticated DnD Bot, serving as a personalized wiki for our DnD journey (ongoing project) 

### 2. TicTacToe AI (contribution)
- A venture into the world of AI, unraveling the intricacies of programming a game 'enemy.'
- Delving into logic and pitfalls, this project serves as a foundation for broader insights into artificial intelligence.

### 3. File Sorting Program
- Developed by request to streamline file organization.
- Ideal for a daily file influx, set to autostart, ensuring seamless organization every time the computer boots up.

## Overview
